# Hi there 👋  

I'm **Rishabh Agrahari**. I started programming in 2015 and immediately fell in love with it. At heart, I'm a programmer—I can build things. Think of anything a programmer can create, and I can do it. I'm deeply passionate about bringing cutting-edge applied AI to Indian industries. After working in startups for five years, I quit my job in early 2025 to start my own company. Right now, I'm working on the most ambitious project of my life—and I’ve never been this happy! 😊  

A little more about me: I'm from **Uttar Pradesh, India**, and I hold a **Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering** from **IIT BHU, Varanasi**.
