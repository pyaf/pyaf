# Hi   

I'm Rishabh Agrahari. I started programming in 2015 and immediately fell in love with it. At heart, I'm a programmer - I can build things. I'm deeply passionate about bringing cutting-edge applied AI to Indian industries. I am the founder of Sanchai Analytics, where we are building Agentic AI solutions for Renewable Energy Industry of India and the world.
