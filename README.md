# Hi there 👋  

I'm **Rishabh Agrahari**. I started programming in 2015 and immediately fell in love with it. At heart, I'm a programmer—I can build things. I'm deeply passionate about bringing cutting-edge applied AI to Indian industries. I am the founder of Sanchai Analytics, where we are building Agentic AI solutions for Renewable Energy Industry in India and the world.

A little more about me: I'm from **Uttar Pradesh, India**, and I hold a **Bachelor's and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering** from **IIT BHU, Varanasi**.
